# NASA Image Library

### If I had more time I'll
- add tests for data decoding, view models
- add support for Light and Dark modes
- search by location and photographer
- fix the scrolling issue when loading next page
- better performant network calls
- add more UI refinements

### I placed the emphasis on
- network calls and data models
- architecture - MVVM
- code quality

### Notes
- The NASA endpoint is very flaky - sometimes it would give errors for the network call
