# NASA Image Library

### If I had more time I'll
- add tests for data decoding, view models
- add more UI refinements
- add better error handling - ex. alert controller, errors to reflex http response codes, localized desciptions
- add debouncing logic for network requests

### I placed the emphasis on
- network calls and data models
- architecture - MVVM
- code quality

### Notes
- The NASA endpoint is very flaky - sometimes it would give errors for the network call
